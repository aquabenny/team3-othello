*****************************************************
Files Included:

Othello (folder) - Eclipse Project Folder
example.xml 	 - Example XML File (Shows parsing capability)
scoreSchema.xsd	 - XML Schema file

*****************************************************
Notes:

1) In order to test the XML file, it needs to be located at '/sdcard/example.xml' for the virtual device to see it.
2) On occasion, a few files get included in the project that do not belong. If errors occur due to the Thumbs.db files,
delete the "Thumbs.db" from the folders and try to build the project again. I tried to make sure they were not in our submission.
